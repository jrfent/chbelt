# README for CH Belt application

This was an application that I built to show a frozen fruit and vegtable company how we could use Ruby on Rails to create a directory of products that they could easily maintain themselves.  Apparently they did not like the demo or the pricing, because they did not even give me the courtesy of saying 'No'.  So, I keep the project live just as something to look back on as an early dev project.

Now this project was not a total loss because some of the technology that I developed for this was also used in some of my other projects.

First, one of my crazy projects that seems to run really well:  [Pilot Car Companies](https://pilotcarfinder.com) directory.  This site is designed to be a nationwide directory of pilot car operators in the USA.  I spent a huge amount of time coding it and it is a very awesome project and has potential to be much more.  I am allowing pilot car companies to list their businesses there for free right now and hope to add some affiliate style advertising to it someday soon.  

My pilot car directory ranks fairly well in the search engines and I hope that it will gain popularity.  Right now, it has 106 pilot car companies listed in it.  Well, that's not completely true - there are some [towing company](http://renotahoetow.com) listings thrown in too.

Anyway, back to the CHBelt project.  It was live at heroku - but is no longer.  I might light it back up soon.
